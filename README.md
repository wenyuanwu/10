## 10

### Background

10 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game inspired by 1024. The blocks follow the following rules: 

1) Each block is assigned a initial value from 1 to 4 
2) Only block in a cluster(has shared border with block of the same value) would be able to be removed
3) The cluster of the block would be removed all together and replaced by one block with the value as the original value plus 1 
4) The goal is to generate a block with value 10 in a limited number of moves
